## PAR: Political Actor Representation Learning with Social Context and Expert Knowledge @ EMNLP 2022.

paper link: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08362)

When will I finally have time to tidy up everything? Constantly chasing this or that every single day.

Maybe you can first explore the learned representations of the 1,069 political actors, with names in `entity_list.txt` and representation vectors in `learned_reps.pt` using torch.load('learned_reps.pt').

Should you have any questions or need me to upload a clean version of the rest of the code, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Citing it?
